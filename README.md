# Recursive Square Root

Perform all calculations for this problem in single precision.

Suppose $x = 100.0$.
Write C++ code that applies $\sqrt{x}$ recursively `n` times.
Then, reconstruct the original value of `x` by multiplying $x * x$ a number of times equal to `n`.
Perform this process for values of $n = 2$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $30$, $40$.
